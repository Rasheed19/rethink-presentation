# rethink-presentation
With **Rethink presentation**, 
I aim to help researchers to produce 
figures and tables that _blend_ with your
texts in any LaTeX editor. By blending with
your texts, I mean you don't need to resize
figures when preparing your write up as this 
usually reduces the quality of the figures. In 
addition, you use the same font and fontsize (as
in your document) right from creating the figures
as well as styling them beautifully.
Figures and tables are produced with Python and Latex 
respectively which are parts of the results 
from my PhD study. 

The codes need not to be followed to
letters but focus on the parts that create
and style the entire plots and tables. That is the main
thing!

I hope you will be able to use these templates
and codes as *starting point* to produce 
amazing and publication-standard results!
